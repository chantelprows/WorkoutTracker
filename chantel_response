Pitch Response – Chantel Prows
I would be a good addition to this team, because I have a lot of experience with Node.js and Vue.js and believe I could be helpful.  I have also worked a little bit with Mongo and am quite familiar with SQL.

Business:
Ad space geared toward health and fitness is great.  We could maybe come up with features for “premium” users.

Legal:
Definitely agree with letting the users know what will be done with their data if we do anything with it.

Technical:
I am biased toward Vue.js because I know it so well, but I think it is a great technology.  Node.js keeps it simple on the backend.  
I am more familiar with DynamoDB than I am with Mongo, but I think both are sufficient and achieve similar goals.
